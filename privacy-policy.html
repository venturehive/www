            <p><strong>Flitepath LLC</strong> and <strong>Venture Hive LLC</strong> (together, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) created this Privacy Policy to advise you about our information practices: the types of information we collect, how we use it, your privacy rights, and how the law protects you. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Also review our <a href="https://www.venturehive.com/terms">Terms of Use</a>, which govern your use of the Sites (defined below).</p>

            <h2>I. IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND WHO WE ARE</h2>
            <h3>A. APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all websites, features, or online services owned or controlled by Flitepath LLC, Venture Hive LLC, or any of their affiliates or associated companies (collectively, the “Sites”), whether accessed via computer, mobile device, or otherwise. For convenience, we refer to these together as the “Service.” This Privacy Policy does not cover unaffiliated websites that link to our Sites; please review those sites’ privacy practices separately.</p>

            <h3>B. PURPOSE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your Personal Information through the Service, including any information you provide when you sign up for communications, purchase a product, or request further information or services.</p>
            <p>Read this alongside any other privacy notices we may provide on specific occasions when we collect or use your Personal Information. Those notices supplement—but do not override—this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h3>C. CHILDREN</h3>
            <p>The Service is not intended for children, and we do not knowingly collect information from anyone under age 16. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected Personal Information from a child under 16, we will delete it promptly.</p>

            <h3>D. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR DUTY TO INFORM US OF CHANGES</h3>
            <p>This version was last updated on 05/28/20. We may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised version on our Sites. Changes take effect immediately upon posting. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email or through the Sites. Unless you consent otherwise, we will not use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time of collection.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for keeping your Personal Information accurate and up to date. If your information changes, please let us know and we will update our records as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
